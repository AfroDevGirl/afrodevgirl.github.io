				<p>My name is Alexis and I love technology! I'm interested in not just personal computers but bluetooth, RFID, apps, medicine, and bringing as much technology to as many people around the world as possible. I believe that technology, and the discovery of technology, is the life blood of a free and good society. Through technology humanity can become more sustainable, educated, and overall better than we are today. For me though I started my education at Bowling Green State University where in 2012 I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts Communications in Theatre: Design/Technical. Essentially that's a really fancy way of saying I can design sets, lights, and costumes for stage and event production. Theatre has always been a big part of my life but through the trial and tribulations of life I learned that I wanted to do more with my time here on earth. That realization led me back to my love of technology and subsequently it's ability to be an incredible part of human existence. I want to be a part of it. So I'm currently a student at Dev Bootcamp while paying the bills as a Lyft driver. I am so grateful for this opportunity to not just have a career but to do something meaningful with my life.</p>
				<p>Well that was certainly verbose! In the spirit of Dev Bootcamp i'd like to share a few facts about me. Maybe we have something in common!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I am a quidditch player and coach. Yes you read that right. The sport from the Harry potter series. No I don't fly but I do tackle, run, and throw dodgeballs.</li>
					<li>I am a former cast member for The Walt Disney Company. I worked at Epcot <strong>and</strong> The El Capitan Theater in Hollywood.</li>
					<li>My favorite food is macaroni and cheese. I love all versions of it and if I really wanted to I could eat it all day every day!</li>
				</ul>
