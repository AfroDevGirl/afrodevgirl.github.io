        First off welcome to my blog! As a child of the internet this isn't my first time in the rodeo, LiveJournal anyone? But this is the first time I'm writing a blog on my own website purely talking about web development, so bare with me! I want to start off talking about a wonderful thing called version control. This handy little concept is the bread and butter of organized coding. Version control is generally a piece of software (aka VCS) that helps a programmer keep track of all changes to a project and allows an entire team to work on a project without stepping on each other's toes by branching out the code in versions. The great thing about version control is that it's not just used in programming. You can use VCS in business project management, construction, and education. The possibilities are endless!

        One of the most popular VCS systems is Git. Used mostly in a terminal, like Bash or PowerShell, it allows the user to edit and update their files before sending them to the master project.It tracks every time an edit (commit) is "pushed" up from the local computer and by whom the commit was submitted.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
