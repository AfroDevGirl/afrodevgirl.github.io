				<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
				<h4>Sub-Header</h4>
				<h5>8/10/2015</h5>
				<p>I've been talking so much about Ruby and all of it's capabilities that I haven't taken the time to talk about how to turn those mehtods into applications on the web. So how do we do that? Well it all comes down to Ruby on Rails, aka Rails. Rails is a MVC (Model, View, Controller) framework that allows an application to access all of the wonderful Ruby methods, classes, and variables we create. The great thing about Rails is that it makes assumptions for a developers every day tasks and allows them to do more with less code leading to efficiency and overall greater productivity.</p>
				<p>There isn't nearly enough space to talk about the intricacies of Rails without a massive step-by-step guide. That said, there are some principles inherit in the framework that is necessary for success. First, the concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding. DRY is a relatively simple concept although it can be difficult to implement, especially for novice programmers. Essentially DRY code encourages simplicity and uses loops to iterate through similar algorithms. The second concept is Convention over Configuration. This concept encourages users of Rails to study and practice the community conventions of the language and use those conventions instead of creating configuration files that explain every piece of code.</p>
				<p>That's about it on Rails. Send me an email if you think I should include more on the topic!</p>
