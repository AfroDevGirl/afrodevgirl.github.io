			<h1>My Values</h1>
			<h2>Spoiler alert: I have a bleeding heart.</h2>
			<h3>08/03/2015</h3>
			<p>There are a lot of things that I value in others. Honesty, integrity, and compassion all come to mind. But until now I haven't really considered what I value in myself. These insular values are what makes up my thought processes and they are something I try to emulate every day of my life. After careful consideration I've come up with a list of the things that matter to me most.
				<ul>
					<li>Community</li>
					<li>Creativity</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
					<li>Excitement</li>
					<li>Freedom</li>
					<li>Helping Others</li>
					<li>Leadership</li>
					<li>Stability</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Although all of the aforementioned values are important to me one truly stands out as my most valued value. I think that helping others is one of the most important traits of being a global citizen. I always try my best to conduct myself in a way that prioritizes other's needs. I love volunteering and giving to charity when I can. Even though this is what I value most now I definitely didn't always feel like this. It's been a journey of self-improvement that never truly ends.</p>
			<p>All of that said I did recently offer some advice to a friend in need. They were having an issue coming to grips with how they felt about another person. I told them that, while emotions can be messy and difficult to understand, ultimately it is more important to be hapy and satisfied in the moment. To be free of labels and social constraints. This friend told me that the advice I had given was a huge help. I could not have been more ecstatic! One small moment meant the world to me. And really life is made of small moments. Everyone deserves to enjoy every moment we get on this Earth, I most enjoy those moments in which I can help others enjoy their moments. </p>
