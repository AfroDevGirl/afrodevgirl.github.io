      Hello and welcome to my way less technical blog! Here you'll find me happily stumbling my way through Dev Bootcamp and it's culture. So let's get started shall we? 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am beyond ecstatic to be a part of this program. My entire life as a student has been about regurgitating material I don't care about or that isn't relevant to my life. What initially attracted me to the program, and what is even more apparent as I finish my first week, is this is an experience. I'm finally learning in a holistic way and I couldn't be happier. I've never been in a more supportive and awesome group of people, and it's only been a week! I can't wait to actually get on-site and really get to the nitty gritty with these amazing individuals in my cohort.

      That said, I can't deny getting to on-site is kind of terrifying. Making mistakes in the safety of my own home is easy. I can take a minute, check my email (or twitter), and then come back to the issue whenever I have a problem. But on site it's hours upon hours of working through issues, something I'm not used to. But I think I'll be ready for it. If this first week has taught me anything it's that whenever I fall down I'll get picked back up by my peers. Over the years asking for help has been very hard for me. I think, through DBC, that less than positive trait of mine will go by the wayside. As Shareef said, DBC is what we make it, and I plan on making this the most transformative experience of my life.

      I think that's all the rambling I have in me for today! Keep checking this space for my mostly coherent thoughts on my DBC experience.
